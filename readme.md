# target-experience-templates

Adobe Target Experience Templates are pre-coded samples with configurable inputs to be used in Adobe Target Visual Experience Composer to execute some common use marketer use cases.

* [Demos] - coming soon
* [Issues](https://github.com/Adobe-Marketing-Cloud/target-experience-templates/issues)

These experience templates are provided free to developers and marketers as a starting point to execute some common external use cases in Adobe Target - either via the Visual Experience Composer or Form Composer. Customization may be required to integrate successfully with your webpage or platform architecture.

This repository is a work in progress and feedback and contribution is most welcome!
